  <h1>About Kathy Jo Pollack</h1>

  <div class="section">
    <p>I feel as though my coaching practice has been in the works for two decades... waiting patiently as I compiled my life experiences (which now exceed three decades).</p>
    <p>My first passion, financial freedom, evolved from presenting over 600 financial seminars to more than 15,000 people throughout Western Pennsylvania as the Training Specialist for Consumer Credit Counseling Service (CCCS). This continued in my work at Back on Track Employee Assistance Program (EAP), and further evolved into other "life" areas through my work at UPMC Passavant Hospital, and later Washington EAP Services and other various EAPs and organizations.</p>
    <p>I found that as I reached out to my audiences, with <em>honesty</em> and <em>integrity</em>, people began to explore their personal financial situations. They started <em>setting goals</em> and realized their own <em>power</em> not only with their finances, but in other areas of their life as well. In fact, <strong>it was a past attendee who came to me several years later to tell me what a lasting impression I made on her life</strong> and suggested that I take my passion another step further and become a life coach.</p>
    <p>Today, my business continues to grow and flourish with the additions of relationship and etiquette coaching. <strong>My focus remains on the basics — <em>helping my clients build a strong and lasting foundation for success in their personal and professional lives.</em></strong></p>
