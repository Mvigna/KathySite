    <div class="testimonials">
      <div class="testimonial-card">
        <p>"Since working with Kathy Jo over just 3 or 4 months, I have been able to see where my money was going, where I was 'leaking' money. In her calm coaching and inquiries, she helped me see what moves would be better for me financially. She helped me build a budget and not forget anything, so now I do not worry about 'surprises' popping up. Most importantly, she helped me build self confidence that I can manage my finances, make good decisions, pay debt, keep my small savings intact, and increase my credit score. It has been painless, educational, very helpful and enjoyable to work with Kathy Jo. I look forward to always having her as my personal 'support team'."<br/><strong>- Roberta P., West Virginia</strong></p>
